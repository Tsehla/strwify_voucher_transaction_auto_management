proper documentation should be produced, when i do get time, but codes and some readme.txt in folders contains some guidance


----
for radius link dont include "/" after url in keystone admin menu hotspot pages menu i.e http://127.0.0.1 not http://127.0.0.1/

----

for free voucher, 

  -> option 1 : you can enable trial user login on mikrotik and enable mikrotik trial login in keystone admin menu hotspot menu
  
  -> option 2 : you can create free voucher that are verified on mikrotik router, you will have to create that users on mikrotik
  
  -> option 3 : you can create free vouchers that will be verified on radius server, if radius server link is provided in keystone admin menu hotspot pages menue
  
  
  for option 2--
  -> you have to define or create a voucher in keystone admin menu [ voucher codes ] menu, the voucher should have value of 0, to be considered as free
  -> if multiple voucher have value of free, first voucher will be used,
  -> ensure that voucher username and passwords are included that matches voucher username and password you defined in mikrotik user account
  -> select type of free login method in keyston hotspot pages
  
  for option 3
   -> you have to define or create a voucher in keystone admin menu [ voucher codes ] menu, the voucher should have value of 0, to be considered as free
  -> if multiple voucher have value of free, first voucher will be used,
  -> ensure that voucher username and passwords are included that matches voucher username and password you defined in radus app [ vouchers menu ]
  -> when creating the new voucher, pay attention to a little button about reset usage when creating the voucher
  -> tip:: if creating using create voucher instead of create username and password, the voucher produced will have password same as username or voucher code defined
  -> select type of free login method in keyston hotspot pages
  
  Tip :: if you are using radius authentication, disable any mikrotik users, as you ay have a situation where for example a users was meant to be authenticated on radius but mikrotik is authenticating them on itself as there is an account with similar username defined, this may cause authentication failure if passwords are not same, this is especially so for free vouchers, as option 1 and 2, shares the same vouchers in keystone [ vouchers codes menu ]
